# online_teamspeak_v1

I decided to create an online, browser version of the popular program 'TeamSpeak 3'

Currently, version 1 only supports chat, but once version 1 is perfected, version 2 will be remade completely from scratch, and hopefully
actual voice communication will be possible (through stream with websockets? I have no clue.)

If you have any suggestions or fixes, or perhaps a better websocket script. Please submit an issue or pull request (I have no idea what a pull request is, I think is helpful?)
