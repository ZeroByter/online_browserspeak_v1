# online_teamspeak_v1
This a project to bring the commonly used 'TeamSpeak 3' desktop program to the browser, no need to host a ts3 server and connecting to it from the browser, I mean an actual whole 'teamspeak like' websocket server run by 100% browser power.

# Is there voice communication for version 1?
No, for now version 1 is all about focusing on perfecting the app, but once it is done, version 2 will be worked on and the entire mission of version 2 is to add microphone voice communication, maybe we will rewrite the entire thing from scratch if needed.

But don't worry! For now atleast you can use normal chat and move along channels!

# Is there MySQL involved?
Yes, MySQL is used to store clients and channels of the server, turning on the server without setting up a MySQL connection or without having a database will cause the server to madly throw arrows at you and not work!

# Sounds cool! How can I help?
You can help by going over the code and helping comment on and post issues about anything from CSS bugs, code optimization, or more importantly secure fixes and improvements.

Happy chating!
